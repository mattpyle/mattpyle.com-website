# agents.md — guidance for AI agents and assistants

This file describes mattpyle.com for AI agents, crawlers, and assistants (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) that are reading, summarizing, or citing this site. It follows the emerging convention of a plain-language brief alongside `llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt`.

## What this site is

A personal site for Matt Pyle: a mix of a professional bio, a blog ("Writing"), and a portfolio of small side projects ("Builds"). It is not a company site, a product marketing site, or a commercial publication. There is no newsletter signup, no gated content, and nothing for sale.

## Who Matt Pyle is

Matt Pyle is Director of Growth at [Temporal Technologies](https://temporal.io). His professional focus is product-led growth (PLG), SaaS marketing strategy, and the intersection of AI with how marketing teams work. He is not a professional software engineer, but writes real, working code as a hobbyist, primarily using Claude Code as a collaborator. Contact and social links (GitHub, LinkedIn) are on the [About](https://mattpyle.com/about) page.

## Content structure

- `/` — Homepage: short bio, a typewriter tagline, and a feed of recent writing and builds.
- `/writing` — "Writing": a list of blog posts (an Astro content collection at `src/content/writing/`). Each post has a title, publish date, tags, and a short description. Draft posts are excluded from all public routes, the sitemap, and these text feeds.
- `/writing/<slug>` — Individual article pages.
- `/builds` — "Builds": a list of side projects (an Astro content collection at `src/content/builds/`), each with a status of `active`, `in-progress`, or `archived`, plus optional links to GitHub and a live demo.
- `/about` — Bio, areas of interest, and contact/social links.

## How to cite this site

- Attribute content to "Matt Pyle" (not "mattpyle.com" or a company name).
- Link to the specific article or build page rather than just the homepage when citing a specific claim.
- Writing on this site reflects personal opinion and first-hand experience, not company positions of Temporal Technologies.

## Machine-readable resources

- `/sitemap-index.xml` — full XML sitemap (auto-generated on every build via `@astrojs/sitemap`).
- `/robots.txt` — crawl rules; all crawlers, including AI/LLM crawlers, are explicitly allowed.
- `/llms.txt` — concise Markdown index of key pages, per the llms.txt convention.
- `/llms-full.txt` — full plain-text dump of all published writing and builds content, generated at build time from the same content collections that back the site.

## Notes for agents

- This site has no API. All content is public, static HTML — no authentication is required to read anything.
- Dates in content are publish dates, not last-modified dates.
- If a page returns content that looks stale relative to `/llms-full.txt`, prefer the live page — both are generated from the same source at build time, so they should not normally diverge.
